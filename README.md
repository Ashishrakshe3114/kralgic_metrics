🧠 Mini Machine Learning Project — Kraljic Dataset Analysis
📘 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analysis and visualization workflow using the Kraljic dataset.
The goal is to explore the dataset, analyze feature relationships, and visualize important business insights using Python’s data science libraries.

All the steps — from importing data to performing analysis — are implemented in the Jupyter Notebook mini_project_ml_2.ipynb.

🔍 Project Workflow
1. Data Loading

The dataset realistic_kraljic_dataset.csv is loaded using Pandas and explored to understand its structure and content.

2. Data Exploration

Display of dataset columns, data types, and summary statistics.

Identification of missing values or anomalies.

3. Data Visualization

Distribution of numerical and categorical variables.

Correlation heatmaps using Seaborn.

Boxplots, bar charts, and histograms to visualize feature relationships.

4. Feature Insights

Analysis of key patterns in the dataset.

Visualization of trends and outliers to extract actionable insights.
